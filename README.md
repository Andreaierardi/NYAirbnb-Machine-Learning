# Statistical-Learning-Project

# Exam 
The exam consists in two assignments, one on the first part(regression, tree, neural nets) and the second part (unsupervised learning). For both you must prepare a writing report using one or more techniques and comparing their performance on one or more data set chosen by the student. A brief oral presentation of the reports will be asked. 

Each report must contain:

- short **abstract**: what are your going to present in the report
- **statement** of the problem/**goal** of the analysis and description of the **data set**(s)
- list of three to five **findings/keypoints**
- the analysis with **wise** commentary
- (optional) theoretical background of the used methods
- **conclusions**(should include the findings/keypoints)
- the **Appendix**, containing all the R code

Notice:
- The **paper length** is irrelevant provided that the content is correct.
- **No R code in the main text**. The R code must be confined to the appendix
- The report should be prepared in **PDF** only

The (PDF) report should be sent, along with the R code, to silvia.salini@unimi.it send it a week before the scheduled exam. When possible, the oral discussion will take place on the date, time, classroom set for the exams. Based on the number of students, the timetable will be sent to you. **NEW: The oral discussion can also take place inavirtual through Microsoft Teams.**
